  comment: Black widow spiders rarely kill humans, but their bite might have enough
    venom to take down a rooster.  But if the rooster steps on the spider immediately
    after being bit (thus easily killing it), and takes a few hours to die, does the
    rooster still win because it lasted the longest?

  comment: All depends on whether or not the sloth can eat the spider before the spider
    bites it!  Could be both would lose if spider bit the sloth and then the sloth
    ate the spider.  Spider would die first, though.  Therefore, I vote sloth!
